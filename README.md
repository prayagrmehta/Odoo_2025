# Skill Swap Platform

## 🚀 Problem Statement

The Skill Swap Platform aims to create a collaborative digital space where individuals can exchange skills and knowledge with one another. In a world where learning is continuous and diverse, many people have unique skills they’re willing to share — from programming and design to cooking and music — but lack access to formal educational channels or finances.

This platform bridges that gap by allowing users to:

- Offer their skills in exchange for learning others.
- Create and join interest-based groups.
- Schedule sessions and track learning progress.
- Build a portfolio of shared knowledge and contributions.

Ultimately, Skill Swap fosters a decentralized learning environment driven by the community.
